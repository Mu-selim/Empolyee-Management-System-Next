# Next (empolyee management system)

Next is a employee management system windows application which is built and released using (C#) .net framework and MS SQL server as a database

In this project I tried to apply my knowledge to make a practical real world project.
I used Microsoft dot net  technology as much I know. I also used programming concepts such as OOP, methods, loops and SQL queries.

## Next (employee management system) system includes:
- Multi-Forms
- User Control
- Dashboards
- System Drawing
- panels
- UI techniques
